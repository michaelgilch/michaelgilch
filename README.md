## Hello, I'm Michael Gilchrist ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for creating intuitive software that requires little to no instruction for the user and increasing productivity by automating as much as possible. 

I currently work for a Medical Device Manufacturer in the Cleveland, Ohio area.
